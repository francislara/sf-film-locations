## SF Film Locations - An analysis of the most popular film locations in SF

### Background and Overview

SF Film Locations is a data visualization tool that lets you see the most popular places in SF where movies were filmed.

Locations with multiple movies filmed there will be a different color, users will be able to click the location and a menu will popout showing all the movies filmed there.

### Functionality & MVP  

In SF Film Locations, users will be able to:

- [ ] View all films on the map at once
- [ ] Filter by movie
- [ ] Filter by year
- [ ] Filter by activity
- [ ] Click a link to the movie's IMDb page

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] An About modal describing the basic functionality

### Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with the simulation canvas, playback controls, probabilities controls, instrument selectors and nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn, and the About and Details modals.  

The simulation canvas will include a dropdown for selecting the initial color of the creation object. Users will click and drag to create objects of a certain size and vector angle.

Playback controls along the top will include Start, Pause, Restart and Reset buttons.

On the left, there will be an expandable menu allowing the user to control the sound event transition matrix and the color evolution matrix.

On the left near the bottom, will be an expandable menu allowing users to select the 'instruments'.


### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and logic,
- `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation and rendering,
- `d3.js` to display and map out all the date,
- `Google Maps API` to accurately display the film locations in relation to an actual map
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.


### Implementation Timeline

**Over the weekend**:

- [x] Research d3.js
